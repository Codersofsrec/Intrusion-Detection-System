# Intrusion-Detection-System
**Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS)** safeguard networks from threats. This project uses the KDD Cup dataset and Random Forest (RF) algorithm to detect intrusions efficiently. Feature selection enhances accuracy and reduces false positives. Scalable and resilient, it strengthens security and mitigates risks.
